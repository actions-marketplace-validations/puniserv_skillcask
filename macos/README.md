# Skillcask for macOS

A SwiftUI app over the `skillcask` CLI (spec D35). It runs on macOS 14 or newer; building it needs
Xcode 26.x with Swift 6.3 or newer (CI builds it with Xcode 26.6, Swift 6.3.3; Xcode 26.0 to 26.3
ship Swift 6.2). The Command Line Tools alone are not enough: SwiftUI's macro plugins (`@State`,
`@Entry`, `#Preview`) ship only with Xcode, so `test.sh` and `bundle.sh` stop at once without it.
How the app looks and behaves, and the rules it keeps: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Try it

```sh
macos/bundle.sh                    # universal Skillcask.app with the CLI inside, plus a zip
open macos/.build/Skillcask.app
```

Without a bundle, `swift run Skillcask` from `macos/` starts the app against the CLI it finds: the
path set in Settings, else `PATH`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin` and `~/.cargo/bin`.
`SKILLCASK_UI_FIXTURES=1 swift run Skillcask` starts it on the built-in sample data and runs no CLI.
The app needs skillcask 0.9.4 or newer and asks to upgrade an older one.

## Build the app

`bundle.sh` builds the app (one universal SwiftPM build) and the CLI (one cargo build per
architecture, joined with `lipo`) from this repository for arm64 and x86_64, renders the icon from
`icon.svg` (Quick Look, `sips` and `iconutil`, all part of macOS), and writes:

- `macos/.build/Skillcask.app`, with the CLI at `Contents/Helpers/skillcask`, which the app prefers
  over `PATH` unless Settings names a binary;
- `macos/.build/Skillcask-<version>-macos-universal.zip`.

The version is the one in `Cargo.toml`. `SKILLCASK_CLI=<path>` bundles a prebuilt CLI instead;
`SIGN_IDENTITY` picks the signing identity (default `-`, ad hoc). Both Rust targets must be
installed (`rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin`) unless `SKILLCASK_CLI` is
set.

## Signing and Gatekeeper

The bundle is signed ad hoc with the hardened runtime, inside-out (the helper, then the app), not
notarized: it opens on the machine that built it. Gatekeeper blocks a downloaded copy ("cannot be
opened" / "damaged"). On macOS 14, right-click the app and choose Open. On macOS 15 and later, try
to open it once, then choose Open Anyway in System Settings › Privacy & Security. Clearing the
quarantine flag after unzipping also works, but do it only for a copy you built yourself or got from
a source you trust:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Skillcask.app
```

Distributing the app needs a Developer ID Application certificate (`SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID
Application: …" macos/bundle.sh`) and notarization with the maintainer's Apple Developer account
(`xcrun notarytool submit <zip> --wait`, then `xcrun stapler staple` on the app, and zip again).

## Test

```sh
macos/test.sh                      # lint, build and tests; fails on any compiler warning
macos/Scripts/smoke-app.sh         # launches the built app and checks it uses the bundled CLI
```

Extra arguments go to `swift test` (`macos/test.sh --filter ProcessRunner`);
`SKILLCASK_BIN=<path>` also runs the contract tests against that CLI. An incremental build hides
warnings in unchanged files, so trust a count of 0 only after `swift package clean`. CI's
`macos-app` job runs `test.sh` on a clean checkout.

`smoke-app.sh` needs a logged-in GUI session. It checks the app's `--version` refusal, then starts
the built app on the sample data and live (with a fresh `SKILLCASK_HOME` and a `PATH` without
skillcask), signals only the processes it started, and restores the app's defaults afterwards.

## Render the previews

```sh
TZ=UTC macos/Scripts/render-previews.sh           # every registered preview (UTC: dates match on every Mac)
macos/Scripts/render-previews.sh --list           # the preview ids
macos/Scripts/render-previews.sh P1-1             # one id or prefix
```

Each preview is drawn offscreen in light and dark at 2x into
`macos/.build/renders/<id>/{light,dark}/<state>.png` (git-ignored). The script fails when the build
fails or a PNG is missing or blank.
