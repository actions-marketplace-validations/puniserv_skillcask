# Smoke test for the packaged app (run ./bundle.sh first): ./Scripts/smoke-app.sh [path/to/Skillcask.app]
#
# 1. `Contents/MacOS/Skillcask --version` must exit 64 within 2 s (the CLI-style refusal, before any window).
# 2. Fixture start (SKILLCASK_UI_FIXTURES=1): reads its resources through `Bundle.module` at launch, so it
#    must still be alive after a few seconds with exactly one on-screen window: the resource bundle
#    resolves inside the .app. It runs no CLI, so it is also the control for the access-time signal below
#    (it runs first: the system's scan of a freshly built bundle on first launch reads the helper too).
# 3. Live start with a fresh SKILLCASK_HOME and a PATH without skillcask, so the bundled
#    `Contents/Helpers/skillcask` is the only CLI it can use. For ~10 s the process started here stays
#    alive, no other new process of this bundle's executable appears, and its children stay few. The
#    positive proof that the bundled CLI was accepted is exactly ONE on-screen window: the main window
#    without the CLI onboarding sheet (a sheet is a window of its own) and without a duplicate. The
#    helper's access time moving past the launch is a secondary signal (its `--version` probe takes
#    milliseconds, shorter than a `ps` sample, and another copy of the app may run the same helper).
#
# Only the PIDs started here are ever signalled (no name-based kills); a copy of the app the user already
# runs from the same bundle is left alone and not counted. The app's defaults domain is exported first and
# imported back afterwards (or deleted when it did not exist), so the user's settings come back as they
# were. Needs a logged-in GUI session (the window checks use the window server). Exits non-zero on any
# failure.
