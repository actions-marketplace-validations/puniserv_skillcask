///   recorded (`ActionRunner.run`'s `onEnd`), before the scope's refresh: at exit 0 the sheet closes at once, so the
///   toast shows while the list header carries the refresh (S11), and the progress never outlives the runner's
///   `current` (no frame shows the progress block without its transcript).
/// - `startBatch`: one command per item, in order (Adopt-States "Adopting 9 skills · 4 of 9"): each item gets its
///   own result and duration, a failure stops the rest, Cancel stops after the current item (finished items stay),
///   one summary toast at the end instead of one per item, and the sheet can close only once the batch ended.
