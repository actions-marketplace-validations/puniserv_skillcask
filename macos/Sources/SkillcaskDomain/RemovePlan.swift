/// drops each from skills.toml and skills.lock with its files and links, then settles the dependencies, so:
/// - every skill of a removed package goes, selected or not (`siblings`);
/// - a dependency whose every requirer is removed goes too (`orphans`, Remove board "Dependency chain");
/// - a package that another package (one not removed with it) still requires leaves skills.toml but stays installed
///   as a dependency
///   (`kept … as a dependency`, `src/commands.rs` `remove`). `status` drops the `via` of a package that is also in
///   skills.toml, so only `info <package>`'s `why` lines (passed in as `why`) tell; a package without them is
///   `unchecked`, and the alert hedges instead of promising its files go;
/// - a dependency on its own cannot be removed ("is a dependency; remove what requires it"), and project and
///   hand-written skills are not packages: those are `refusals`;
/// - a not managed skill has no lock entry, so the CLI cannot remove it and the app changes no file of its own
///   (D35): `notManaged` lists it, and the alert only offers to reveal it.
