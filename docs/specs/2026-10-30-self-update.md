# Spec: `skillcask self-update`

Date: 2026-10-30. Status: accepted as D52 (2026-10-30), which amends D51.

## Problem

`skillcask self-check` (D51) says that a newer release exists, and the README tells people to update
"the same way you installed". Most people do not remember how they installed, and the commands
differ per method: `brew upgrade`, `npm install -g`, `cargo install`, or the release's installer
script run again. Only the installer script can be re-run by skillcask itself without fighting a
package manager.

Goal: one command that updates an installer-script install and, for every other method, prints the
exact command to run.

## Constraints

- **The shell installer and `cargo install` both write `~/.cargo/bin/skillcask`.** dist installs
  to `CARGO_HOME` (`install-path = "CARGO_HOME"` in `dist-workspace.toml`), so the path alone does
  not tell them apart.
- **The installer writes a receipt**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/skillcask/skillcask-receipt.json` (default
  `~/.config/skillcask/`; `%LOCALAPPDATA%\skillcask\` on Windows) with `install_prefix`,
  `install_layout` and `version`. `cargo install` writes `~/.cargo/.crates2.json` (or
  `$CARGO_HOME/.crates2.json`) instead. A later `cargo install` over an installer install leaves
  the receipt behind.
- **A running binary cannot simply be overwritten.** Linux refuses to write an executing file
  (`ETXTBSY`), macOS may kill a process whose signed pages change, Windows locks a running `.exe`.
- **The installer verifies the archive, not itself.** Each `skillcask-installer.sh` embeds the
  sha256 of every archive of its release and checks the download; the script itself has no
  published checksum. Its integrity rests on HTTPS to github.com, as for the first `curl | sh`.
- **`install --frozen` and the package invariants are untouched.** The installer is skillcask's own
  release artifact, not package content; skillcask still never runs anything from a package.

## Proposal

### 1. Command

`skillcask self-update [--dry-run]`, outside any project, like `self-check`. No `--json`, no
`-g`, no confirmation prompt: running the command is the consent. `--dry-run` prints the detected
method and the command or installer URL it would use, and runs nothing.

### 2. Latest version

The same anonymous request as `self-check` (D51). No newer version: prints
`skillcask X is the latest` and exits 0. Unparsable `latest`: exits 1 and names the release page.

### 3. Install method

From `std::env::current_exe()` with symlinks resolved, first match wins:

| Detected | Action |
| --- | --- |
| path inside `*.app/Contents/Helpers/` | print `brew upgrade skillcask-app` or the app installer command, exit 1 |
| path contains `/Cellar/` | print `brew update && brew upgrade skillcask`, exit 1 |
| path contains `node_modules` | print `npm install -g skillcask@latest`, exit 1 |
| `.crates2.json` lists `skillcask` and the exe is in that `CARGO_HOME/bin` | print `cargo install --locked skillcask`, exit 1 |
| receipt with `install_layout` `cargo-home` and exe `== <install_prefix>/bin/skillcask` | Unix: run the installer (§4). Windows: print `irm https://github.com/puniserv/skillcask/releases/download/v<latest>/skillcask-installer.ps1 \| iex`, exit 1 |
| anything else | print the release page and the README's update commands, exit 1 |

`.crates2.json` comes before the receipt because both live in `~/.cargo`. Exit 1 means "nothing was
updated, run this", so a script does not mistake a printed hint for success.

### 4. Running the installer (Unix)

1. `GET https://github.com/puniserv/skillcask/releases/download/v<latest>/skillcask-installer.sh`
   with `Http::anonymous` (no credential, D51), at most 256 KiB (the 0.10.1 script is 55 KiB). The
   tag, not `/latest/`, so the version installed is the one step 2 reported.
   `SKILLCASK_SELF_UPDATE_URL` replaces the URL for tests and mirrors.
2. Write it to an unnamed temp file (`tempfile::tempfile`), so nothing is left behind.
3. Print `updating skillcask X -> Y with <url>`, then `exec` `sh -s` with that file as stdin and
   `SKILLCASK_INSTALL_DIR=<install_prefix>`, `SKILLCASK_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1` in the environment: the
   same as the documented `curl … | sh`, into the same directory, without editing shell profiles
   again.

`exec` replaces the skillcask process with `sh`, so nothing of skillcask runs while the installer
replaces the binary, and no file is left in the temp dir. A failed download exits 3 before `exec`.

### 5. Documentation

README "### Update": `skillcask self-update` first; it runs the installer for an installer-script
install and prints the command for every other one. D52 records the decision and amends D51's
"skillcask does not update itself".

## Tests

- Unit tests for the detection table on fake paths, receipts and `.crates2.json` in a temp dir.
- `tests/self_update.rs`, against a local server through `SKILLCASK_SELF_CHECK_URL` and
  `SKILLCASK_SELF_UPDATE_URL`: up to date, unknown install, `cargo install`, and on Unix the test
  binary copied to `~/.cargo/bin` with a receipt, where a served script records its environment
  (the real `exec`), `--dry-run` runs nothing and the script's exit code comes back.

## Rejected

- **`axoupdater`** (dist's updater crate, `install-updater = true`): it does the same, but brings
  its own HTTP stack next to `Http` and a second set of network rules to keep in line with D43/D51.
- **Downloading the archive and swapping the binary in skillcask**: a self-updater with its own
  checksum, rename and rollback code, for what the installer already does and verifies.
- **Running the installer on Windows**: the running `.exe` is locked; renaming it aside and cleaning
  up a `.old` file later is code and risk for one command that the user can paste.
- **Running `brew`, `npm` or `cargo` for the user**: they may need `sudo`, a different prefix or a
  shell with the right `PATH`; printing the exact command is enough.
